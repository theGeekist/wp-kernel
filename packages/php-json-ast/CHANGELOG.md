# Changelog

All notable changes to `@wpkernel/php-json-ast` will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

### In progress

- **Phase 7 – Plugin bootstrap flow** – Tasks 37-45 will deliver the create bootstrap, plugin loader, regeneration cleanup, and activation smoke; no JSON AST changes are expected unless the bootstrap helpers surface new schema needs.
- **Phase 8 placeholder** – Task 46 will collect incremental diagnostics (starting with the CLI LogLayer reporter) after the bootstrap flow ships.
