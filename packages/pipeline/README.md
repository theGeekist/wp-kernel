# @wpkernel/pipeline

Composable execution primitives for coordinating WPKernel workloads. This package extracts the reusable pipeline scaffolding so other workspaces can orchestrate staged behaviours without depending on the entire core runtime.

## Status

The package currently provides lightweight builder utilities. Additional behaviours will land as the pipeline is extracted from `@wpkernel/core`.
