# @wpkernel/intermediate-representation

Shared intermediate representation (IR) types that describe the structures emitted by kernel compilation passes. The package centralises IR contracts so transports, optimisers, and emitters can collaborate without tight coupling.

## Status

The initial release focuses on the core data model. Transformations and validation helpers will follow.
