# @wpkernel/test-utils

Shared testing utilities for the WP Kernel monorepo. This package exposes domain-specific harnesses for WordPress globals and integration workspaces so packages can share deterministic test setup without duplicating helpers.

The package is internal during the MVP rollout and will stabilise once the remaining helpers migrate from their originating packages.
