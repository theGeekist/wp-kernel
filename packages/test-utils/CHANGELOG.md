## Unreleased

### In progress

- **Phase 6 – Core pipeline alignment** – Awaiting Tasks 32-36 to determine if
  shared harness updates are required for the new pipeline orchestration.
- **Phase 7 – Plugin bootstrap flow** – Tasks 37-45 will deliver the create bootstrap, plugin loader, regeneration cleanup, and activation smoke before 0.11.0 ships; reflect any harness updates required by that flow.
- **Phase 8 placeholder** – Task 46 will collect incremental diagnostics (starting with the CLI LogLayer reporter) after the bootstrap flow ships.
