# @wpkernel/php-driver

## Unreleased

### In progress

- **Phase 7 – Plugin bootstrap flow** – Tasks 37-45 will deliver the create bootstrap, plugin loader, regeneration cleanup, and activation smoke; no driver updates are expected unless the bootstrap flow surfaces installer changes.
- **Phase 8 placeholder** – Task 46 will collect incremental diagnostics (LogLayer reporter, transcript polish) after the bootstrap flow ships.
