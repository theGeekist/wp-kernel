## Development Workflow

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: v22.20.0 LTS (use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
- **pnpm**: v9.12.3 or later
- **Docker**: For local WordPress environment
- **Git**: For version control

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/theGeekist/wp-kernel.git
cd wp-kernel

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start WordPress with seed data
pnpm wp:fresh

# Start watch mode for development
pnpm dev
```

See [Development Setup](/contributing/setup) for detailed instructions.

### Common Tasks

See [Runbook](/contributing/runbook) for detailed instructions on:

- Starting/stopping WordPress
- Running tests
- Building packages
- Seed data management
- Troubleshooting

### Coding Standards

See [Coding Standards](/contributing/standards) for:

- TypeScript guidelines
- ESLint rules
- Naming conventions
- File structure
- Import/export patterns

### Testing

See [Testing Guide](/contributing/testing) for:

- Writing unit tests
- Writing E2E tests
- Running tests locally
- Test fixtures and seed data

## Versioning

WP Kernel uses manual semantic versioning with fixed versioning across all packages.

### Updating Versions

After making changes, update CHANGELOG.md files:

```markdown
## 0.x.0 [Unreleased]

### Added

- Your feature description

### Fixed

- Bug fix description
```

### Version Bump Guidelines

- **One CHANGELOG update per PR** (usually)
- **Clear descriptions** - Users will read these in the changelog
- **Correct bump type**:
    - **Major**: Breaking changes, event taxonomy changes, slot changes
    - **Minor**: New features, new events/slots (non-breaking)
    - **Patch**: Bug fixes, documentation, internal refactors

Example changeset:

```markdown
---
'@geekist/wp-kernel': minor
---

Add support for custom cache invalidation strategies in Resources.

Resources can now define custom `shouldInvalidate` functions to control when cache keys are invalidated:

\`\`\`typescript
export const thing = defineResource({
// ...
shouldInvalidate: (action, payload) => {
return action === 'update' && payload.status === 'published';
},
});
\`\`\`
```

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, semicolons, etc.)
