- **Review `RELEASING.md`** in project root for sprint-driven re2. **Maintainer reviews** PR changes.

3. **Maintainer merges** PR to main.
4. **Maintainer prepares release** by updating versions and tagging.
5. **Maintainer publishes** to npm manually.

## Quick Reference

````bash
# Before starting
git checkout -b feature/my-feature

# While working
pnpm test
pnpm lint

# Update CHANGELOG.md in affected packages

# Before pushing
git add .
git commit -m "feat: my feature"
git push origin feature/my-feature
```e workflow

## Creating a Pull Request

### 1. Fork & Branch

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub
# Then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/wp-kernel.git
cd wp-kernel

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/wpkernel/wpkernel.git

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
````

### 2. Make Changes

Follow [Coding Standards](/contributing/standards):

```bash
# Make your changes
# ...

# Run tests
pnpm test
pnpm e2e

# Run lint
pnpm lint

# Run typecheck
pnpm typecheck
```

### 3. Update CHANGELOG

**For feature PRs**, update CHANGELOG.md files in affected packages:

```markdown
## 0.x.0 [Unreleased]

### Added

- Bindings & Interactivity (Block Bindings, Interactivity API, Providers)

### Fixed

- Bug fix description
```

**Direct commits to `main`** (infra/docs only) do **not** trigger releases.

> **See `RELEASING.md`** in project root for the canonical sprint PR workflow and versioning guidelines.

### 4. Commit Changes

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat(resources): add custom cache invalidation"
```

### 5. Push & Open PR

```bash
git push origin feature/my-feature
```

Then open a PR on GitHub **using the PR template** (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`).

**✗ Never create ad-hoc PRs without the template!**

---

## PR Template

**Always use** `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` when creating PRs. The template includes:

- Scope identification
- Roadmap and sprint doc links (please include)
- Release type selection (minor/patch/major)
- CHANGELOG.md confirmation checklist
- Testing and verification steps

### Required Sections

1. **Upcoming work** - describe the focus (feature/alignment/norms)
2. **Scope** - Brief description of changes
3. **Context** - Links to roadmap, sprint doc, and related PRs/issues
4. **Testing** - How to test the changes
5. **Release** - Bump type and CHANGELOG confirmation

See `RELEASING.md` in project root for the canonical sprint PR workflow.

## PR Requirements

- [ ] **Lint passes** - Zero ESLint errors.
- [ ] **CHANGELOG.md updated** - Unless docs-only change.
- [ ] **Conventional commits** - Proper commit message format.
- [ ] **Description** - Clear what/why/how.

### Should Have

- [ ] **Tests for new code** - Unit tests for new functionality.
- [ ] **E2E tests** - For user-facing features.
- [ ] **Documentation** - Update docs for API changes.
- [ ] **Examples** - Update examples if relevant.

### Nice to Have

## Review Process

### CI Checks

All PRs must pass CI:

- ✓ Lint
- ✓ TypeScript
- ✓ Build
- ✓ Unit Tests
- ✓ E2E Tests

### Code Review

1. **Automated review** - CI checks run automatically.
2. **Maintainer review** - One approval required.
3. **Changes requested** - Address feedback and push updates.
4. **Approved** - PR is ready to merge.

### Merge Strategy

- **Squash merge** - All PRs are squashed into one commit.
- **Commit message** - Should follow Conventional Commits.
- **Branch deletion** - Feature branch is deleted after merge.

## Common Scenarios

### Addressing Review Feedback

```bash
# Make changes based on feedback
# ...

# Commit
git add .
git commit -m "refactor: address review feedback"

# Push
git push origin feature/my-feature
```

CI will re-run automatically.

### Updating from Main

```bash
# Fetch latest
git fetch upstream

# Merge main into your branch
git checkout feature/my-feature
git merge upstream/main

# Resolve conflicts if any
# ...

# Push
git push origin feature/my-feature
```

### Amending Commits

```bash
# Make additional changes
# ...

# Amend previous commit
git add .
git commit --amend --no-edit

# Force push (only on your fork!)
git push origin feature/my-feature --force-with-lease
```

### Updating Changeset

````bash
```bash
# Update CHANGELOG.md in affected packages
# Add/modify entries under ## 0.x.0 [Unreleased]

# Commit
git add packages/*/CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "chore: update changelog"
git push
````

## PR Types

### Bug Fix

```markdown
## What

Fix validation error for empty description field.
```

````

## PR Types

### Bug Fix

```markdown
## What

Fix validation error for empty description field.

## Why

Users were unable to submit things without descriptions, even though description is optional.

Fixes #123

## How

Updated validation schema to allow empty strings for description field.

## Testing

1. Navigate to Things page
2. Click "Add New"
3. Enter title only, leave description empty
4. Click "Create"
5. Thing should be created successfully
````

### New Feature

```markdown
## What

Add custom cache invalidation strategies for Resources.

## Why

Some resources need fine-grained control over when cache is invalidated based on the specific action and payload.

## How

Added optional `shouldInvalidate` function to resource config that receives action and payload and returns boolean.

## Testing

See new unit tests in `packages/core/src/__tests__/resource.test.ts`.

## Breaking Changes

None. This is an optional enhancement.
```

### Documentation

```markdown
## What

Document block bindings usage patterns.

## Why

Users were asking how to implement server-side bindings for SEO.

## How

Added comprehensive guide with examples in `/docs/guide`.

## Testing

Review documentation locally:

1. `pnpm docs:dev`
2. Navigate to Guide → Block Bindings
3. Verify examples are clear
```

### Refactor

```markdown
## What

Extract transport retry logic into separate utility.

## Why

Retry logic was duplicated across resource methods. Extracting improves maintainability.

## How

Created `packages/core/src/transport/retry.ts` with exponential backoff implementation. Updated all resource methods to use it.

## Testing

All existing tests pass. Added unit tests for retry utility.

## Breaking Changes

None. Internal refactor only.
```

## Troubleshooting PRs

### CI Failing

#### Lint Errors

```bash
# Check locally
pnpm lint

# Auto-fix
pnpm lint:fix

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "style: fix lint errors"
git push
```

#### Test Failures

```bash
# Run locally
pnpm test
pnpm e2e

# Debug
pnpm test --watch
pnpm e2e --headed

# Fix and push
```

#### Build Errors

```bash
# Clean build
rm -rf node_modules pnpm-lock.yaml
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

### Merge Conflicts

```bash
# Fetch latest
git fetch upstream

# Rebase on main
git rebase upstream/main

# Resolve conflicts
# Edit conflicting files
git add .
git rebase --continue

# Force push
git push origin feature/my-feature --force-with-lease
```

### Changeset Missing

````bash
### CHANGELOG Missing

```bash
# Update CHANGELOG.md in affected packages
# Add entries under ## 0.x.0 [Unreleased]

# Commit
git add packages/*/CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "chore: update changelog"
````

````

## After Merge

### Clean Up Branches

```bash
# Delete local branch
git checkout main
git branch -d feature/my-feature

# Delete remote branch (if not auto-deleted)
git push origin --delete feature/my-feature
````

### Update Local Main

```bash
# Fetch and pull latest
git checkout main
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

## Release Process

Releases are automated:

1. **Maintainer merges PRs** with changesets.
2. **Changesets bot** opens "Version Packages" PR.
3. **Maintainer reviews** version changes and changelog.
4. **Maintainer merges** version PR.
5. **GitHub Actions** publishes to npm automatically.
