# @wpkernel/e2e-utils

`@wpkernel/e2e-utils` layers kernel helpers onto the WordPress Playwright stack so end-to-end suites can seed resources, wait on stores, and diff manifests. Follow the Playwright guide for suite authoring and the framework contributor companion before extending fixtures or workspace helpers.
