# Directories

Map applied artifact identifiers to workspace-relative paths. Supports keys:

- `blocks`, `blocks.applied`
- `controllers`, `controllers.applied`
- `plugin`, `plugin.loader`

Use this when you need generated/apply outputs to land outside the defaults. See the appendix entry for details and accepted shapes: [directories in appendix](/reference/config/appendix#directories).
