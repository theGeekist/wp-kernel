# WPKernel API

The generated API reference lives under this directory. Each package exposes a `README.md` that mirrors the corresponding package overview inside the repository. Start from [/api/index](./index.md) to browse by package, or jump directly to a package root such as [@wpkernel/cli](./@wpkernel/cli/README.md).

For the narrative guides, visit the [Guide section](../guide/index.md) or the [Reference index](../reference/contracts.md).
